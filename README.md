# Uber_data_engineering_project
I built a data engineering pipeline using Pandas, Google Cloud, Mage, and BigQuery. Key steps included data cleaning, transformation, and modeling for structured analysis. I set up a Google Cloud instance, used Mage for automation, exported data to BigQuery, merged tables, and visualized insights in Looker Studio, ensuring efficiency &amp; scalability.
